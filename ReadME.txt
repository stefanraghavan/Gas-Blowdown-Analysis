BACKGROUND:

This program calculates pressure, temperature and flow rate of a real gas over time during a
blowdown process. A blowdown process is a depressurization event where gas escapes from a
pressurized volume through a metering device (typically a valve, orifice, nozzle or leak).

Two blowdown processes are analyzed: isothermal and adiabatic. The difference between these
processes lies in how temperature and heat transfer are managed during the depressurization
of the gas.
